# Node Client for Google Maps Services

Node library for accessing the Google Maps Web Services.
Works both with callbacks and promises (depends on whether you pass in a callback or not).

## Usage

Look into tests (they are not really tests :D).

## Currently implemented

- [x] Distance Matrix API
- [ ] Directions API
- [ ] Elevation API
- [ ] Geocoding API
- [ ] Time Zones API
- [ ] OAuth

## Why making a new one ?

If you write libraries with global configuration I automaticcaly assume your library is not gonna work.
